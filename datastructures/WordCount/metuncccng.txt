METU NCC Computer Engineering Program

The METU NCC CNG Undergraduate Program provides professional training in Computer Engineering. The program, aimed at meeting the demand for BS level computer engineers in industry, business and in higher education, covers a wide range of areas in the field of computer engineering, including programming languages, computer architecture, data structures, algorithms, theory of computation, databases, software engineering, embedded systems, graphics, operating systems, and networks. It also address other core and supporting areas, such imagine processsing, e-business, intelligent systems, distributed and parallel systems, knowledge engineering, etc.

The preparation of students to be successful in Computer Engineering practice is the primary objective of the program. Graduates will be able to pursue advanced studies in Computer Engineering  and Computer Science on a competitive universial basis.

The focus of the first two years of the undergraduate program is on foundational courses, which provide a solid basis for some concurrent courses and most of the courses taken in the last two years which are related to the computer engineering field in general, as well as applied and advenced topics. Undergraduate students spend a total of eight weeks in industrial practice during the summers. As an integral part of undergraduate study, students are given numerous assignments, many of which require team work and collaboration, essantial qualities for success in today’s world. Assignments of this nature foster a collaborative atmosphere in and outside of class, not only between students, but also involving close interaction with the teachers and assistants.
