# C Codes
This repository includes the codes which written in C. Some of them are my previous assignments, some of them are the ones that I wrote for fun.
### Data Structures
Several data structure implementations and a project named "WordCount" which is based on "Binary Search Tree".
### fun
The codes that I wrote for fun.  
There is a game that can be played on the console named "simplecrush" which is similar to the "Candy Crush".  
There is also my solution for the "Painter's Dilemma" question from  "IEEEXtreme 10.0 Programming Competition".
